# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides secure authentication for existing users to access their accounts on the dating platform. The login system supports multiple authentication methods, implements security measures against brute force attacks, and maintains user sessions through JWT tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account using my credentials (email and password), so that I can access my profile and start matching with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to main dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display error message without revealing which field is incorrect
4. WHEN a user submits empty fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors for required fields
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL generate JWT token and establish user session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account to be protected from unauthorized access attempts, so that my personal information and matches remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fails login THEN the system SHALL log the failed attempt for security monitoring
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display generic error message without revealing specific field errors
3. WHEN multiple failed attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
4. WHEN successful login occurs THEN the system SHALL log successful authentication event
5. WHEN user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and user permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have my login session remember my preferences, so that the system can show me relevant matches based on my gender preferences when I return.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL load their gender and gender preference settings
2. WHEN user session is established THEN the system SHALL prepare matching algorithm based on gender preferences
3. WHEN user accesses discovery features THEN the system SHALL filter potential matches by gender preferences
4. WHEN user updates gender preferences THEN the system SHALL update session data immediately
5. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all preference data from session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to be secure and automatically managed, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in while maintaining account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate JWT token with 1-hour expiration
2. WHEN JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL use refresh token to generate new JWT automatically
3. WHEN user is inactive for 30 days THEN the system SHALL invalidate refresh token and require re-login
4. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both JWT and refresh tokens
5. WHEN user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and user permissions
