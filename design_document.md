DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
Project Name: Interest-Based Dating Platform
Last Updated: July 18, 2025

I. Introduction
This document outlines the system design, architecture, technology stack, and UI/UX considerations for the development of an interest-based dating application that matches users based on shared interests and preferences.

II. System Architecture Overview
2.1 Components
Component
Description
Web App
ReactJS
Backend API Server
Handles user auth, profile data, match logic, chat
Matching Engine
By user’s matching gender.
Database
Stores user data, interests, matches, messages
Real-time Messaging
WebSocket or Firebase-based for chat system
Media Storage

III. Data Model Design
3.1 Key Entities
User

interests (array of tags), photos, preferences
Interest
id, category (music, travel, etc.), label

Match
user_id_1, user_id_2, match_date, status (liked, matched)
Message
sender_id, receiver_id, timestamp, message_content, read_flag
Database will use relational PostgreSQL schema.

IV. API Design (Sample Endpoints)
Endpoint
Method
Description

V. Security Considerations
Authentication: JWT-based auth tokens
Password: Hashed (bcrypt) and salted
Rate Limiting: Protect APIs from abuse (especially messaging & like endpoints)
Data Protection: End-to-end encryption for chats (future phase)

VI. Deployment & CI/CD
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Hosting:
Backend: Render
DB: Supabase
Static Assets: R2
Monitoring: Sentry (for error tracking)

VII. Future Enhancements
AI-powered match insights (e.g., “Why you matched”)
Voice and video calling
Weekly interest-based events or match campaigns
Public stories (Instagram-style profile moments)
