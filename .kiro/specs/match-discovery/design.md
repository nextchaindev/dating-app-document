# Match Discovery Feature Design

## Overview

The match discovery feature provides the core functionality for users to find and interact with potential romantic partners through an intelligent matching system. The feature combines algorithmic matching based on shared interests, location proximity, and user preferences with an intuitive swipe-based interface for quick decision-making and mutual connection discovery.

**Design Rationale:** A card-based discovery interface with swipe gestures provides familiar UX patterns from successful dating apps while the underlying matching algorithm prioritizes compatibility factors that lead to meaningful connections. The system balances user choice with intelligent suggestions to optimize both engagement and match quality.

## Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
User Preferences → Match Generation → Card Display → User Action → Match Processing → Mutual Match Detection
```

### System Components

- **Matching Engine**: Core algorithm for generating compatible user suggestions
- **Discovery Service**: Manages match card presentation and user interactions
- **Preference Service**: Handles user filtering and matching criteria
- **Action Service**: Processes likes, passes, and undo operations
- **Match Service**: Detects mutual matches and manages match history
- **Profile Service**: Provides detailed profile views and compatibility scoring

**Design Decision:** Event-driven architecture allows real-time match processing and enables scalable handling of user actions. The matching engine operates independently to pre-generate suggestions, improving response times during peak usage.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Matching Engine Component

**Purpose:** Generate compatible user suggestions based on multiple compatibility factors

**Interface:**

```typescript
interface MatchingEngine {
  generateMatches(
    userId: string,
    filters: MatchFilters,
    limit: number
  ): Promise<MatchSuggestion[]>;
  calculateCompatibilityScore(
    user1: UserProfile,
    user2: UserProfile
  ): Promise<CompatibilityScore>;
  updateMatchPool(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  getMatchingCriteria(userId: string): Promise<MatchingCriteria>;
}

interface MatchSuggestion {
  userId: string;
  compatibilityScore: number;
  sharedInterests: string[];
  distance: number;
  lastActive: Date;
  priority: number;
}
```

**Matching Algorithm Factors:**

- **Interest Similarity**: Weighted scoring based on shared interests (40% weight)
- **Location Proximity**: Distance-based scoring with user-defined radius (25% weight)
- **Age Compatibility**: Preference-based age range matching (20% weight)
- **Activity Level**: Recent app usage and engagement patterns (10% weight)
- **Profile Completeness**: Bonus scoring for complete profiles (5% weight)

**Design Rationale:** Multi-factor scoring ensures diverse compatibility assessment while interest similarity receives highest weight as it correlates strongly with long-term compatibility. Pre-computation of match pools improves real-time performance.

### 2. Discovery Service Component

**Purpose:** Manage match card presentation and user interaction flow

**Interface:**

```typescript
interface DiscoveryService {
  getNextMatch(userId: string): Promise<MatchCard | null>;
  processUserAction(
    userId: string,
    targetUserId: string,
    action: UserAction
  ): Promise<ActionResult>;
  undoLastAction(userId: string): Promise<UndoResult>;
  getMatchHistory(
    userId: string,
    type: "liked" | "passed" | "matched"
  ): Promise<MatchHistory[]>;
  refreshMatchPool(userId: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface MatchCard {
  user: PublicProfile;
  compatibilityScore: number;
  sharedInterests: string[];
  distance: string;
  photos: Photo[];
  isLastCard: boolean;
}

type UserAction = "like" | "pass" | "super_like";
```

**Card Management Features:**

- **Smart Prefetching**: Load next 3-5 cards for smooth transitions
- **Deduplication**: Prevent showing previously seen users
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful messaging when no matches available
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading of profile images and data

**Design Rationale:** Card-based interface with prefetching ensures smooth user experience. Action processing is asynchronous to prevent UI blocking while maintaining immediate visual feedback.

### 3. Profile Detail Component

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive profile viewing with enhanced interaction options

**Interface:**

```typescript
interface ProfileDetailService {
  getDetailedProfile(
    viewerId: string,
    profileId: string
  ): Promise<DetailedProfile>;
  getCompatibilityBreakdown(
    userId: string,
    targetId: string
  ): Promise<CompatibilityBreakdown>;
  reportProfile(
    reporterId: string,
    profileId: string,
    reason: string
  ): Promise<void>;
  blockUser(blockerId: string, blockedId: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface DetailedProfile {
  basicInfo: PublicProfile;
  photos: Photo[];
  videos?: Video[];
  bio: string;
  interests: InterestCategory[];
  compatibilityScore: number;
  sharedInterests: string[];
  mutualConnections?: MutualConnection[];
}
```

**Enhanced Features:**

- **Photo Gallery**: Smooth scrolling with zoom capabilities
- **Video Support**: Auto-play with sound controls
- **Compatibility Insights**: Detailed breakdown of matching factors
- **Safety Features**: Report and block functionality
- **Mutual Connections**: Display shared social connections (if available)

**Design Rationale:** Detailed profiles enable informed decision-making while maintaining user safety through reporting mechanisms. Compatibility insights help users understand match quality beyond surface-level attraction.

### 4. Filter and Preference Component

**Purpose:** Advanced filtering system for refined match discovery

**Interface:**

```typescript
interface PreferenceService {
  updateMatchPreferences(
    userId: string,
    preferences: MatchPreferences
  ): Promise<void>;
  getAvailableFilters(userId: string): Promise<FilterOptions>;
  applyFilters(userId: string, filters: ActiveFilters): Promise<FilterResult>;
  resetFilters(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  getFilterSuggestions(userId: string): Promise<FilterSuggestion[]>;
}

interface MatchPreferences {
  ageRange: [number, number];
  maxDistance: number;
  genderPreference: string[];
  dealBreakers: string[];
  mustHaveInterests: string[];
}

interface ActiveFilters {
  education?: string[];
  occupation?: string[];
  lifestyle?: string[];
  relationshipGoals?: string[];
  customFilters?: CustomFilter[];
}
```

**Filter Categories:**

- **Basic Filters**: Age, distance, gender (free users)
- **Lifestyle Filters**: Education, occupation, smoking/drinking preferences
- **Interest Filters**: Specific hobby or activity requirements
- **Premium Filters**: Advanced criteria like income, height, relationship goals
- **Custom Filters**: User-defined criteria combinations

**Design Rationale:** Tiered filtering system balances accessibility for free users with advanced options for premium subscribers. Smart suggestions help users optimize their filter settings for better match results.
