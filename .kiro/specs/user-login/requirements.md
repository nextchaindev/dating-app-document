# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides secure authentication for existing users to access their accounts on the dating platform. The login system supports multiple authentication methods, implements security measures against brute force attacks, and maintains user sessions through JWT tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into my account using my credentials (email/phone and password), so that I can access my profile and start matching with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display login form with email/phone and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to main dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display error message without revealing which field is incorrect
4. WHEN a user submits empty fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors for required fields
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL generate JWT token and establish user session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account to be protected from unauthorized access attempts, so that my personal information and matches remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fails login 5 times THEN the system SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes
2. WHEN account is locked THEN the system SHALL display lockout message with remaining time
3. WHEN lockout period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically unlock the account
4. WHEN user attempts login during lockout THEN the system SHALL extend lockout by 5 minutes
5. WHEN successful login occurs THEN the system SHALL reset failed attempt counter

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in using my social media accounts (Google/Facebook), so that I can access the platform quickly without remembering passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks social login button THEN the system SHALL redirect to OAuth provider
2. WHEN OAuth authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or link account and log user in
3. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display error and return to login page
4. WHEN social account is not linked THEN the system SHALL prompt to link with existing account or create new one
5. WHEN social login is successful THEN the system SHALL generate JWT token same as regular login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to be secure and automatically managed, so that I don't have to repeatedly log in while maintaining account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate JWT token with 1-hour expiration
2. WHEN JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL use refresh token to generate new JWT automatically
3. WHEN user is inactive for 30 days THEN the system SHALL invalidate refresh token and require re-login
4. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both JWT and refresh tokens
5. WHEN user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and user permissions
